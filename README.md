# Logger

> This application was created as part of my research at Virginia Tech. The application and the whole project is no longer active. Files of the project are left here for legacy reasons.

<p>Logger collects anonymous mobile-usage data as part of a research study approved by the <a href=http://www.irb.vt.edu/pages/about.htm target="_blank">Virginia Tech IRB</a></p> 

As described in the [[recruitment letter]](RecruitmentLetter.pdf), volunteer smartphone users are requested to install this Android application (~~available on [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.magnum.logger)~~) on their daily-use Android smartphones, and allow it to run without interruption. 

The application collects anonymous usage data (e.g. location, browsing, communications, connectivity, ...). The application does not collect any identifying information, and the data collected cannot be tracked back to the user. URLs, email addresses, and phone numbers are encrypted (hashed and salted) locally on the phone before being sent to the server. After the first run, the application hardly requires any further interaction from the user.

~~Before installing the application, please read carefully the [[recruitment letter]](RecruitmentLetter.pdf) for more details and instructions.~~

Please feel free to contact me anytime via <a href=mailto:amrabed@vt.edu target="_blank">email</a> for any details or concerns.
